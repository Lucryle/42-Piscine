# ECOLE 42 SHELL-00 WITH 100/100 :) 
## Minimum exercises needed to pass: ex00-ex05

> [NOTE FOR THE ex02]
> If you're getting KO from the moulinette on ex02, you're probably tarring the files incorrectly. Check the subject and read it carefully (The command you need to use is written there, and you must be in the same directory as where return files are).
